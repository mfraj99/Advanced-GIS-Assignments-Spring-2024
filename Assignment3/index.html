                <p>Just like Staten Island this webpage holds a lot of potential.</p>
                <p>The Staten Island Railway is 21 stops from Tottenville in the South to the St. George Ferry Terminal
                    in the North. It is a very quirky system with only two stations, St. George and Tompkinsville ahving
                    fare control. While the SIR is underused now, with further study and planning its role could be
                    augmented.</p>
                <p>This website will continue to be updated with new featured including:</p>
                <p>-Images to indicate ADA accessible stations</p>
                <p>-Geojson lines to show the right of way</p>
                <p>-More maps showing socioeconomic conditions around the Island (maybe with buttons to switch layers)</p>
                <p>-Deactivated historic train routes and possibly bus routes (maybe with an image slider for before and after)</p>
                <p>-Possibly realtime GTFS tracking</p>
