                <p>Just like Staten Island this webpage holds a lot of potential.</p>
                <p>The Staten Island Railway is 21 stops from Tottenville in the South to the St. George Ferry Terminal
                    in the North. It is a very quirky system with only two stations, St. George and Tompkinsville having
                    fare control. While the SIR is underused now, with further study and planning its role could be
                    augmented.</p>
                <p>Six of SIR's station are currently ADA compliant. Some of the Island's densest neighborhoods in the
                    Northwest continue to be underserved by public transit.</p>
                <p>Since assignment 3 a newpopulaton densit map has been added in red along with the railway right of
                    way, icons for stations, a favicon and a hazy outline to focus user attention.</p>
                <p>This website will continue to be updated with new featured including:</p>
                <p>-A map legend</p>
                <p>-Improved visuals for the accessibility of stations.</p>
                <p>-Additional maps to tell a richer story that can be gone through with buttons</p>
                <p>-Being able to click on the census blocks to see more information</p>
                <p>-Deactivated historic train routes and possibly bus routes (maybe with an image slider for before and
                    after)</p>
